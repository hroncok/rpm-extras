This directory contains Build Root Policy scripts. They are supposed to be
executed during (almost) all builds. They typically generate files, clean up
unwanted artifacts or check for unwanted content.

The scripts need to be executable. To use them they need to be added to the
macros used to create the build scripts of the required section.
